# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Joseph Reiss

Time spent: ~2 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
No outside resources used

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The biggest challenge I encountered while creating this project was learning the new programming languages, html, css, and javascript.
I did not have any previous experience with any of these languages, so the syntax and what each of these languages do was new to me.
I found it pretty interesting that you can essentially interweave each of these languages to create one final product. I was able to learn
a lot about how these languages work from the tutorial on codepath and it gave me a good beginners understanding of what can be done with them.
Having to figure out small syntax errors that I encountered while coding was a little difficult because the glitch IDE does not really tell you
exactly where and what is incorrect all of the time. I noticed, this is especially the case if you make errors with spelling in variable names
and functions names etc... As with most IDE's and languages glitch also does not really help much with logic errors, thus figuring out some
small logic errors I encountered, such as incorrect function calling order. Overall I did not encounter any major issues though while creating
this game. Most of the logic and code is comparible to other languages languages and projects in which I have much more experience in.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Are there any other languages that typical mainstream websites use to implement their sites besides html, js, and css? If so what are they and how
are they used differently from what was used in this project? 
It seems as though most of the difficulty in creating a site comes from the logic in the javascript code, is this always the case? Or is this only
because the example was creating a game, I know game logic can sometimes be the most difficult part of a program when creating one.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had some more time to work on this project I would enjoy testing out and adding some different features. I think an options menu would be something cool
to look into implementing that allows the player to set different things such as the clue playback speed, volume adjustments, color adjustments, etc...
I think it would also be cool to experiment with adding a randomized pattern, like the real world game, instead of a preset pattern based on the hardcoded array.
On that same note, it would also be interesting to experiment with varying pattern lengths before the user necessarily "wins".
